Clunker - Zig
=============

Like [clunker](https://github.com/dimi309/clunker), but in Zig. This 
edition however, only works on Windows and it only initialises glfw 
and then creates a Vulkan instance. I have not developed it as much as
[clunker](https://github.com/dimi309/clunker) in Rust, which also draws
a box and also runs on Linux and MacOS.
I just wanted to see what it would be like launching the 
[vulkan_helper](https://github.com/dimi309/vulkan_helper) from Zig.
